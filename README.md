Retrieving valuable insight from historical cryptocurrency data

## Setup

**Environment**

Run the following to set up the libraries necessary for running code:
- if using conda (suggested): `conda env create -f crypto.yml`
- if using pip: `pip install -r requirements.txt`

**Data**

Download the following datasets from Kaggle:
- https://www.kaggle.com/sudalairajkumar/cryptocurrencypricehistory/code
- https://www.kaggle.com/tencars/392-crypto-currency-pairs-at-minute-resolution

Then, create a new folder called "data" in the main repository, and rename the datasets to `crypto_prices` and `crypto_pairs` respectively.
